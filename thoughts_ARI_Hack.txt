Thoughts:

There are a variety of image file types, some of them require special software and lib to read;
the raw jpg images were taken from different height, angel, and some photos has partial or non houses presented;
the orthomosaic images have done the image rectification, correction, so is good to measure distance, a question is
would orthomosaic image be available in testing data as well? can it be used as one of the training data to build a model?
we have 3d mesh(wavefront called, has .obj and .mtl files), point cloud, dsm(tiff) which I guess are all for 3d? how we can read those files and how to use them? 
what differences and how they can be used together with orthomosaic? how image coordiatnes are interprated?

pyglet and pywavefront were installed to read wavefront objects:
install pyglet: pip install pyglet
install pywavefront: download https://github.com/greenmoss/PyWavefront, goto the top directoy
, python setup.py install and pip install PyWavefront, see https://github.com/greenmoss/PyWavefront,
then test using import pywavefront

pcl installation:
conda install -c ccordoba12 python-pcl=0.2
following https://anaconda.org/ccordoba12/python-pcl

PIL can be used to read tiff images

Tried to use pywavefront to read .obj data in 3d mesh folder, when running the script in jupyter notebook,
gets error cant find file in the path, tried to use os.chdir and sys.path.append, none of them work, and then
I tried to run test.py in the folder, it says found texture coordiantes, but no normals;
Tries to run the pyglet_demo.py in pywavefront-master/example folder, it ran successfully using uv_sphere.obj,
when changed to use test.obj cced from 3d_mesh,got same error not found the normals
